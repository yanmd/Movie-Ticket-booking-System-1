<h2> The plot</h2>
<p>A gripping storyline, high-octane action and a dash of drama - Force 2 promises to be one of the thrillers to look forward to in 2016. Set in parts of China, India and Budapest, the story opens when 3 undercover RAW agents are killed in synchronized assassinations across Asia. Tough-as-nails former cop Yash (John Abraham) then sets out to nab the mastermind, who is a mole in the Indian embassy, along with female officer Kiran (Sonakshi Sinha). They are like chalk and cheese with different working styles. Rebooting and building a strong franchise for Force, its second edition will witness larger-than-life action sequences and intense performances.</p>
